- `app/(tabs)/earnings/index.tsx`

## Why This Was a Problem

Having multiple Google Ads conversion tracking IDs (especially 20+) triggers Google's anti-fraud systems because:

1. **Multiple Ad Accounts**: Suggests you're running ads from many different accounts to the same site
2. **Conversion Manipulation**: Could be used to artificially inflate conversion numbers
3. **Policy Violation**: Violates Google's "Circumventing Systems" policy
4. **Cloaking Suspicion**: Multiple tracking IDs can indicate deceptive practices

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Push these changes to your live site immediately
2. **Request Review**: In Google Ads, request a policy review for your disapproved ads
3. **Wait 3-7 Days**: Google typically reviews within this timeframe
4. **Use ONE Account**: If you need conversion tracking in the future, use only ONE Google Ads account with ONE conversion tracking ID

## If You Need Conversion Tracking Again

Only add tracking from your PRIMARY Google Ads account:
```html
<!-- Add to public/index.html -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'AW-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

Replace `AW-XXXXXXXXXX` with your single, primary conversion ID.

## Important Warning

**DO NOT** add multiple conversion tracking IDs again. This will immediately trigger the same policy violation.
